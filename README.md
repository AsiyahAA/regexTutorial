# regexTutorial
## Description
### Project purpose was to create a regex tutorial for a specific regex and upload to gist for users to view the tutorial.
## User
### User should be able to view the tutorial on gitHub repository as well as on gitHub gist and can see a walk-through on how to use a regex for matching an email. 
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and Visual Studio Code was used to write the tutorial along with GitHub gist and GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update respository.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted.
### GitHub gist will be needed to write the tutorial in and will be labeled as a .md file so that is renders correctly.
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS. Starter code folders should be copied onto your own repository and start writing the tutorial in md format along with on gist.
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order to update GitHub.
